<p>flower, the characteristic reproductive structure of angiosperms. As popularly used, the term 
“flower” especially applies when part or all of the reproductive structure is distinctive in colour and form.</p>
<p>A flower having sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils is complete; lacking one or more of such structures,
 it is said to be incomplete. Stamens and pistils are not present together in all flowers.
 When both are present the flower is said to be perfect, or bisexual, regardless of a lack of any other part that renders it incomplete </p>

<p>Lilies, one of the most beloved bulbs for the summer garden, burst in with kaboom blossoms
 at an interlude when most flowers are in a holding pattern. Offering “swoony” scents, strong stems and substantial petals, lilies are also workhorses as cut flowers.</p>

            <p>Lotus flowers are one of the most prominent tokens in Eastern cultures. In Hinduism and Buddhism,
 they’re considered the most sacred flower. Hieroglyphics from Ancient Egypt show this delicate flower alongside priests and 
pharaohs. Statues of Buddhist monks often include a lotus flower. Vietnamese and Indian people often associate the flower with gods and
 goddesses..</p>

            <p>The common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a large annual forb of the genus Helianthus grown as a crop for
 its edible oil and seeds. This sunflower species is also used as wild bird food, as livestock forage (as a meal or a silage plant),
 in some industrial applications, and as an ornamental in domestic gardens. The plant was first domesticated in the Americas. Wild H.
 annuus is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads. The domestic sunflower, however, often possesses only a single large
 inflorescence (flower head) atop an unbranched stem..</p>
