<center><h1>Smart Traffic Management System</h1></center>
<h3>Smart Traffic Management is a system where centrally-controlled traffic signals and sensors regulate 
the flow of traffic through the city in response to demand. Upgrading and integrating all the signals 
on the main roads in the city will:</h3>
<p>Reduce everyday congestion markedly, by smoothing traffic flows and prioritizing traffic in response to demand in real time.</p>
<p>Reduce pollution throughout the city: stop-start driving is inefficient and polluting.</p>

<p>It will also provide a perfect opportunity to install monitoring equipment to collect much more detailed traffic and journey data than we have now. Each set of traffic lights will have communication equipment that can be used to transmit (anonymous) vehicle data, 
either from ANPR cameras or Bluetooth detectors, and CCTV feeds (where appropriate).</p>
<h3>
ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition)</h3><p>software uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities for automatic recognition of vehicles number plates.  ANPR allows you reliably identify vehicles with restrictions (stolen car, not licensed, unpaid fines, etc…), alerting the authorities when they have passed through inspection, allowing immediate action such as seizure of the 
vehicle, surrender of passengers and any other action.</p>  
<p>When passing by the camera,  ANPR get a photo of the vehicle’s number plate, registering it on an images database, with date, hour and camera information, allowing a lot of consults
 and a more effective traffic management.<br><br>Systems commonly use InfraRed (IR) lighting to allow the camera to take the picture at any time of the day. ANPR technology tends to be region-specific,
 owing to plate variation from place to place.</p>

<h1>Smart Traffic Management: Optimizing Your City's Infrastructure Spend</h1>
<p>Smart Traffic Management Systems are technology solutions that municipalities can integrate into their traffic cabinets and intersections today for fast, cost-effective improvements in safety and traffic flow on their city streets. What's more, deploying these systems today, or upgrading your city's existing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure
 can create huge efficiencies and cost savings, while massively improving system reliability, all of which have excellent ROI.

These systems utilize sensors, cameras, cellular routers and automation to 
monitor and automatically direct traffic and reduce congestion. The right technology
 solution can be scaled to any size and painlessly upgraded at any time. Simultaneously,
 these technology solutions prepare Smart Cities for coming technology evolutions, including Connected 
Vehicle and the full deployment of 5G networks.</p>

<h1>Why Evaluate Smart Traffic Technology?</h1>
<p>Budgets for public infrastructure are always tight, and constructing roads and bridges is always expensive. Smart Traffic Management Systems help municipal and regional transportation departments to cope with the situation — quickly and cost-effectively. Integrating smart traffic technology helps them affordably get better performance from their existing infrastructure.

Let's explore how augmenting and retrofitting infrastructure can dramatically improve the efficiency and safety of existing traffic networks.</p>
<h1>Smart Traffic Management: Smart Cities Do More With Less</h1>
<p>The problems plaguing our streets and highways are well known. Traffic slow-downs can cause debilitating congestion and add to urban air pollution. Businesses suffer from delivery delays and lost productivity. Emergency vehicles are slowed down by bottlenecks, potentially putting lives at risk. And all of it diminishes the city's overall quality of life.

Meanwhile, cities and regional governments continually ask their traffic management teams, civil engineers and highway maintenance crews to do more with less. In the face of these challenges, innovative cities — "Smart Cities" — are using a coordinated array of hardware, software and cloud solutions to increase traffic flow and improve safety. Smart Traffic Management Systems, which are included in the umbrella of “intelligent transportation systems” and sometimes called “intelligent traffic management,” are automated systems that incorporate the latest advances in Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

These systems can optimize traffic flow and enhance safety by using sensors, cameras, routers and cellular technology to dynamically adjust control mechanisms such as traffic lights, freeway on-ramp meters, bus rapid transit lanes, highway message boards and even speed limits.</p>
